# OR-Gate-Perceptron
This repository is an implementation of the Perceptron learning algorithm, which is a binary classification algorithm used for supervised learning. The code creates a neural network with two input nodes and one output node, and trains it to classify the inputs into two classes (0 and 1) based on a list of pairs derived from an OR gate truth table. This neural network uses the sigmoid activation function with a threshold of 0.2, and the weights are initially two random numbers between -0.5 and 0.5. The training is performed for a fixed number of epochs at the user's choice and the weights are updated using the error signal and the learning rate. The output of the network for each input is printed along with the desired output, initial weights, error, and final weights for each epoch.
